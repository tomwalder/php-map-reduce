# MapReduce for PHP 
Fan-out, Fan-in Processing, for PHP

## Notes ##

Mostly stolen from Wikipedia, some thoughts my own.

> Processing and/or generating large data sets/or tasks in a parallel, distributed manner

> The "MapReduce System" (also called "infrastructure" or "framework") orchestrates the processing by marshalling the distributed servers, running the various tasks in parallel, managing all communications and data transfers between the various parts of the system, and providing for redundancy and fault tolerance.

> Optimizing the communication cost is essential to a good MapReduce algorithm.
